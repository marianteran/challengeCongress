# Challenge Congress

Second individual challenge requested by minhub, with the following specifications (javascript start)

## ðŸ§¾General Info

You have been asked to create a demo web app displaying Congressional data from the ProPublica Congress API on an HTML page . Specifically, you need to create two pages, one for the Senate and one for the House of Representatives. Both will look very similar. You should try to avoid duplicating code as much as possible.

There are several steps to this task:

Getting an API key for the ProPublica Congress API
Getting the JSON objects for the two chambers of Congress and saving them in files
Creating HTML pages that use JavaScript to display the JSON data in tabular form, and CSS to format the tables nicely
looping over the data about the members of the two houses, counting and adding as you go

##### Final task

Presentation of the sketch to the client

#### Technologie and Library
This project was made using html for the structure, ccs for the styles and Javascript for the consumption of the api and dynamism of the page.
